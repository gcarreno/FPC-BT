# FPC-BT
The intention is to have a Bit-Torrent client.

  * If everything can be modular as in a lib, better yet.
  * All of it in Object Pascal with Free Pascal and Delphi in view.

Let's see how far we get.

# List of Intentions
  * Decode a .torrent file into a Class Object
  * Access a tracker with a Torrent ID
  * Learn about BT protocol
